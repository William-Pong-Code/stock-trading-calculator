# Stock Trading App Instructions

## Overview
Build a beautiful stock trading calculator app that helps users calculate risk management parameters for their trades.

## Features Required

### User Input Fields
1. **Maximum Allowable Loss Amount** - The maximum dollar amount the user is willing to lose (saved in memory for convenience). This field should be first and have a light red background to indicate risk.
2. **Entry Purchase Price** - The price at which the user plans to buy the stock
3. **Stop-Loss Price** - The price at which the user will sell to limit losses
4. **Target Price** (Optional) - The desired profit-taking price target

### Calculated Outputs
1. **Total Invested Capital** = Entry Purchase Price × Number of Shares
2. **Potential Gain %** (if Target Price provided) = ((Target Price - Entry Price) / Entry Price) × 100
3. **Potential Gain** (if Target Price provided) = (Target Price - Entry Price) × Number of Shares
4. **Risk/Reward Ratio** (if Target Price provided) = (Target Price - Entry Price) / (Entry Price - Stop-Loss Price)
5. **Stop-Loss %** = ((Entry Price - Stop-Loss Price) / Entry Price) × 100
6. **Loss Amount** = (Entry Price - Stop-Loss Price) × Number of Shares

*Note: Number of Shares is calculated as (Maximum Allowable Loss Amount / (Entry Price - Stop-Loss Price)) and displayed in the summary section.*

## Design Requirements

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Clean, modern interface with intuitive layout
- Real-time calculations as user types
- Clear labeling of all input fields and results
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Desktop version should utilize the full width with a two-column layout: input fields on the left half and calculated results on the right half, maximizing screen real estate
- Use professional color scheme (blues, grays, whites)
- Include proper validation and error handling
- Tab navigation should skip informational tooltips and move directly between input fields

### Technical Implementation
- **Use vanilla JavaScript only** - No frameworks or libraries required
- Input validation (positive numbers only, stop-loss < entry price)
- Input fields should be `type="text"` with `inputmode="decimal"` to allow full control over validation and cursor position (avoid `type="number"`)
- Input fields should only accept numbers and dots (for decimal numbers), reject all other characters
- Prevent leading zeros except for decimal format (0.xxx is valid, but 00010 is not)
- Format currency values appropriately
- Round calculations to appropriate decimal places
- Add loading states and smooth transitions
- Include tooltips or help text for clarity
- Event listeners for real-time input handling
- DOM manipulation for dynamic updates
- Save Maximum Allowable Loss Amount to localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Reset button should prompt user with three options: "Clear" (keeps max loss amount), "Clear All" (clears everything including max loss), and "Cancel" (cancels the reset)
